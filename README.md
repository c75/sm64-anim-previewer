# Super Mario 64 animation previewer
A (very) WIP online SM64 animation previewer.
Try it here: https://c75.github.io/sm64-anim-previewer/index.html
Use your mouse to drag the camera.

Credits to SM64 decomp team for providing the animation files and helping me understand the format and and Pannenkoek for labeling the animations.

3D is used through THREE.js, including its OrbitControls utility.
